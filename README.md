# Song-Generator

A character-level LSTM is contructed with PyTorch to generate love song. The network will train character by character on some text, then generate new text character by character.

The input used to train this model was from a public dataset on kaggle that has more than 380k lyrics. This model will be able to generate new text based on the text from the lyrics!

This network is based off of Andrej Karpathy's post on RNNs and implementation in Torch.
